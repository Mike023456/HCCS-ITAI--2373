        "\n",
        "**1. Most affected text type:** The \"product review\" text was most affected by pre-processing with about 62% reduction in number of tokens. This is largely due to the high volume of stop words, usage of pronouns and conjunctions present in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Least affected text type:**The \"simple\" text was least affected by pre-processing with about 50% reduction in number of tokens. This is largely due to noise reduction and having a good balance between noise reduction and preserning semantic information required to understand the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. For customer review analysis:** I would prefer standard processing approach which include lemmatization, stop word removal and basic cleaning. This is to allow preservation of the original content of the text, noise reduction and having a good balance that will promote understanding customer's opinion effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Main trade-offs to consider:** I would consider the following trade-offs while carrying out the project. Information preservation versus noise reduction , speed versus accuracy, simplicity versus complexity, recall versus precision in making decisions on what libraries to use that will maintain the originality of the content in context. I do not think there is a general rule to adapt in pre-processing pipeline,and the best approach to use will be largely dependent on the project, specific task and trade-offs that I will be willing to overlook.\n",
