This course is an intensive hands-on class for Artificial Intelligence students. 
The course highlights understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP) using different tools such as Python,Gtihub, Github Desktop, Jupyter, Google Colab with applicable concepts that are available in the IT industry for NLP professionals. 
The course trains students to becoming expertise with understanding of the applicable concepts in the Natural language processing field.
The lab projects are linked in this repository for accessibility and consderation for other project work in the AI industry.
Each Lab project require understanding and application of Python codes along with associated libraries in carrying out the projects with creation of journal explaining the concepts learned from the project and overview of the applications in the future.
Few of the Python packages learned during the course include NLTK, Spacy, String, Re, Scikitlearn, and few of the concepts include tokenization, vectorization, embeddings, POS taggings, semantic analysis.
The course exposes students to appreciate the benefits of using AI agent to check on errors identification in the code, as well as, introducing the importance of using AI agent to understanding basis of the codes and applications.
The course was taught by highly professional instructor with indepth understanding of the field and the applications of Artificial Intelligence in diferent industries.
