This course is an intensive hands-on class for Artificial Intelligence students. 

The course highlights understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP) using different tools such as Python,Gtihub, Github Desktop, Jupyter, Google Colab with applicable concepts that are available in the IT industry for NLP professionals. .

The course trains students to becoming expertise with understanding of the applicable concepts in the Natural language processing field.

The lab projects are linked in this repository for accessibility and consderation for other project work in the AI industry.

Each Lab project require understanding and application of Python codes along with associated libraries in carrying out the projects with creation of journal explaining the concepts learned from the project and overview of the applications in the future.

Few of the Python packages learned during the course include NLTK, Spacy, String, Re, Scikitlearn, and few of the concepts include tokenization, vectorization, embeddings, POS taggings, semantic analysis.

The course exposes students to appreciate the benefits of using AI agent to check on errors identification in the code, as well as, introducing the importance of using AI agent to understanding basis of the codes and applications.

The course was taught by highly professional instructor with indepth understanding of the field and the applications of Artificial Intelligence in diferent industries. 

The following modules were taught in the course:

  Module 01 Introduction to NLP
  
  Module 02 - Text Processing and Cleaining
  
  Module 03 Introduction to Audio
  
  Module 04 Introductions to Text representation

Project 1 - Text Processing and Cleaning

The link to this project is listed below. 

This project requires the students to carry out NLP pre-processing with aim pf cleaning, transforming and preparing the provided raw text data to a system that will be apprpriate for machine learning such as classiication model. At the end of the lab, students are aware of the requirements for standardization, noise reduction, complexity reduction and performance enhancement for any raw text data using natural language toolkit(NLTK) library and SpaCy(Industrial-strength NLP with pre-trained models). Five diferent raw data which include Simple text, Academic text (with citations, URLs), Social media text (with emojis, hashtags), News text (formal writing) and Product reviews (informal, ratings)are used to highlights diferences in applications and outputs using NLTK and Spacy. The concepts of tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization, stemming, text cleaning and normalization are applied on the raw data sets.
