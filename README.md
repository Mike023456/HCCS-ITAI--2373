This course is an intensive hands-on class for Artificial Intelligence students. 

The course highlights understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP) using different tools such as Python,Gtihub, Github Desktop, Jupyter, Google Colab with applicable concepts that are available in the IT industry for NLP professionals. .

The course trains students to becoming expertise with understanding of the applicable concepts in the Natural language processing field.

The lab projects are linked in this repository for accessibility and consderation for other project work in the AI industry.

Each Lab project require understanding and application of Python codes along with associated libraries in carrying out the projects with creation of journal explaining the concepts learned from the project and overview of the applications in the future.

Few of the Python packages learned during the course include NLTK, Spacy, String, Re, Scikitlearn, and few of the concepts include tokenization, vectorization, embeddings, POS taggings, semantic analysis.

The course exposes students to appreciate the benefits of using AI agent to check on errors identification in the code, as well as, introducing the importance of using AI agent to understanding basis of the codes and applications.

The course was taught by highly professional instructor with indepth understanding of the field and the applications of Artificial Intelligence in diferent industries. 

The following modules were taught in the course:

  Module 01 Introduction to NLP
  
  Module 02 - Text Processing and Cleaining
  
  Module 03 Introduction to Audio
  
  Module 04 Introductions to Text representation

Project 1 - Text Processing and Cleaning


This project requires the students to carry out NLP pre-processing with aim pf cleaning, transforming and preparing the provided raw text data to a system that will be apprpriate for machine learning such as classiication model. At the end of the lab, students are aware of the requirements for standardization, noise reduction, complexity reduction and performance enhancement for any raw text data using natural language toolkit(NLTK) library and SpaCy(Industrial-strength NLP with pre-trained models). Five diferent raw data which include Simple text, Academic text (with citations, URLs), Social media text (with emojis, hashtags), News text (formal writing) and Product reviews (informal, ratings)are used to highlights diferences in applications and outputs using NLTK and Spacy. The concepts of tokenization, stop words removal, lemmatization, stemming, text cleaning and normalization are applied on the raw data sets.

Project 2 - Text Representation

In this lab, the students learn how to convert words to numbers showing transformation of human language into mathematical representations that machines can understand, process and learn from. The lab comprises the following paths from basic word counting to sophisticated embedding techniques used in modern AI systems.
Part 1-2: Foundations & Sparse Representations (BOW, Preprocessing)
Part 3: TF-IDF & N-grams (Weighted Representations)
Part 4: Dense Representations (Word Embeddings)
Part 5: Integration & Real-World Applications 
At the completion of this lab, the students are able to convert text to numbers for machine learning, implement Bag of Words and Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) representations from scratch, applying N-gram analysis to capture word sequences, embedding words and their semantic properties, carrying out comprehensive comparison of different text representation methods and building simple text classication system. Few of the Python libraries that are used during the lab include numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikitlearn, math, matplotlib.

Project 3 - Parts of-Speech Tagging

In this lab, the students learn the part-of-speech (POS) tagging and its application in Natural language processing. The students explore how computers understand the grammatical roles of words in sentences, from simple rule-based approaches to modern AI systems. Key learnings from this lab project include understanding POS tagging fundamentals and its benefits in daily applications using NLTK and Spacy for text analysis, explore different tag sets and understand their trade-offs, handling real-world messy text like speech transcripts and social media and applying POS tagging to solve actual business problems.

Project 4 - Sentiment and Emotion Analysis

This lab provides the students the singular opportunity to apply every concepts learn from this course in carrying out this project. The project allows students to build emotion detection system for both text and speech
The lab gives stuents practical experience with real-world emotion analysis.
The following learnings are observed while performing this project:
1. Text Sentiment Analyzer using VADER and TextBlob
2. Machine Learning Classier with scikit-learn
3. Speech Emotion Detector using audio features
4. Multimodal System combining text and speech analysis
The raw data used during this lab include customer reviews from multiple domains, social media posts with emotion labels, audio recordings with emotional speech and Multimodal datasets combining text and audio.
At the end of this project, the students are able to Understand the differences between rule-based and ML approaches to sentiment analysis, build and evaluate multiple sentiment analysis systems extract and analyze emotional features from speech, create a multimodal emotion detection system and critically evaluate bias and fairness in emotion detection systems
